#What did I learn today in python day 1?
#I learned to print string into console.
#I learned to skip to the next line or print the second item into the next line  using \n
#I learned to concatenate string
#I learned input() amd len() functions
#I learned variables - setting input/len or name to variables
#I also did a  mini project that asked for a user's grew they grew in and their pet name and once I get that information, I combined their answer into a single name.
